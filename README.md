# Terraform Next.js Image Optimization module for AWS

[![CI](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js-image-optimization/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js-image-optimization/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

A drop-in [image optimization loader](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#loader) for the Next.js image component `next/image`.

> **Notice:** If you look for a complete solution to host a Next.js application with Terraform on AWS, please check out our [Terraform Next.js module for AWS](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/milliHQ/next-js/aws).

## Features

- ✅ &nbsp;Terraform `v0.13+`
- ✅ &nbsp;Serverless image processing powered by [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- ✅ &nbsp;Powerful optimization using the [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) processing library
- ✅ &nbsp;Performant image caching powered by [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
- ✅ &nbsp;Two-layer caching with [CloudFront Origin Shield](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html)
- ✅ &nbsp;Support for custom [Device Sizes](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#device-sizes) & [Image Sizes](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#image-sizes)

## Architecture

The image optimization module is designed as a full stack AWS app.
It relies on multiple AWS services and connects them to work as a single application:

## Usage

### 1. Deploy the module to AWS

Initialize the module by creating a `main.tf` file with the following content (you can place the file in the same directory where your Next.js project is located):

```tf
# main.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

# Main AWS region where the resources should be created in
# Should be close to where your Next.js deployment is located
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

module "next_image_optimizer" {
  source = "milliHQ/next-js-image-optimization/aws"

  next_image_domains = ["example.com", "sub.example.com"]
}

output "domain" {
  value = module.next_image_optimizer.cloudfront_domain_name
}
```

Then run Terraform to deploy the image optimiziation module to your AWS account:

```sh
terraform init  # Only needed on the first time running Terraform

terraform plan  # (Optional) See what resources Terraform will create
terraform apply # Deploy the image optimizer module to your AWS account
```

After Terraform has successfully created all resources in your AWS account, you should see the following output on the terminal:

```sh
> Apply complete!
>
> Outputs:
>
> domain = "<distribution-id>.cloudfront.net"
```

You should save the `<distribution-id>.cloudfront.net` output somewhere since you need it in the next step.

### 2. Adjust Next.js config

In your Next.js project, open or create the `next.config.js` file and add the following lines (Remember to replace `<distribution-id>` with the output from the previous step):

```diff
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
+  images: {
+    path: 'https://<distribution-id>.cloudfront.net/_next/image'
+  },
}
```

Then rebuild and redeploy your Next.js application to make use of the changed configuration.

## Examples

- [Statically exported Next.js app hosted on S3](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js-image-optimization/tree/main/examples/with-next-js-export)  
  Use the image optimizer together with a statically exported Next.js app that is deployed to S3 and CloudFront.
- [Next.js + Vercel](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js-image-optimization/tree/main/examples/with-next-js)  
  Use the image optimizer together with a Next.js app deployed on Vercel.
- [Existing CloudFront](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js-image-optimization/tree/main/examples/with-existing-cloudfront)  
  Use the image optimizer with an existing CloudFront distribution.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |

## Limits

- Max file size of a resized image is 6mb ([#110](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js-image-optimization/issues/110))  
  Resized images returned by the image optimization API cannot exceed 6mb in size, because this is the maximum allowed [payload size for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html#function-configuration-deployment-and-execution).

## Versioning

The module internally relies on the original Next.js image optimizer.
So the versioning of the module is aligned with the version of the corresponding Next.js release.

For example the [`v10.0.5`](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js-image-optimization/releases/tag/v10.0.5) version of this Terraform module uses the image optimizer from the [Next.js 10.0.5 release](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v10.0.5).

Please note that we only publish versions `>=10.0.5`, for a full list of available versions see the published versions in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/milliHQ/next-js-image-optimization/aws).
